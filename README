YYYY-MM-DD


I will specify  a date > 1/09/2024
1/09/2024
31/08/2024
30/08/2024
if I don't specify a date
The endpoint should use the latest as a marker



fx/{targetcurrency}
fx/EUR?<date>
fx/EUR?date='<date>'













Dealbreakers
Was able to complete the API -> Yes but with bugs
Was able to write executable code -> yes But with bugs
Was able to cover corner cases(In case, invalid String ex :: /GBP?date=XXX) --> No
Was able to parse the incoming target values to the endpoint correctly (Different format dats provided, Multiple dates are provided) --> No

To Consider :: The preparation of final response was the problem.
API was hit correctly for multiple days.


Secondary ---- good to have -- not dealbreakers
Used java 17 or above _> no as in no features used
Used httpclient/ SPring web instead of Resttemplate -> no
Was able to write some junit test -No
USed Lamok or other technologies to reduce boiler code  -> no
Reactive nature of the program || What happens if specify something other than USD as source
